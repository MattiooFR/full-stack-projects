# Project done during my Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree

I used git during all the development of my Udacity Project.

## Fyyur project

The Fyyur project is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues.

The objective of this project was to demonstrate the ability of modeling and creating the databse using the Flask SQLAlchemy mdoule. Using the already made front end, I had to connect all the Form and View to real data saved in the database like :

* creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
* searching for venues and artists.
* learning more about a specific artist or venue.

For more information look at the [README](01_fyyur/README.md) inside the Fyyur folder.

## Trivia App

The Trivia App is the game of Trivia playable online.

The objective here was to create all the API endpoints to retrieve, add or delete questions, categories, .. The main difficulty was to format the data properly to what the front end was expeting.

The second part of the project was to create API endpoints test. Doing tests ensure 3 things:

* Verify that each endpoints is tested and working
* Protect for unexpected bug when doint update to the API
* Ensure that the error are handled as expected

For more information look at the [README](02_trivia_api/backend/README.md) inside the Fyyur folder.
